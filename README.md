# SE Bastille Installer Box

This repository contains Vagrant Packer installation scripts 
that will build a platform-free installer-on-a-VM available on the Vagrant Cloud.  

This will eventually be a replacment of the manjaro-arm-installer
https://app.vagrantup.com/safenetwork-community/boxes/manjaro-arm-installer
although it's first next release will still run the same installer app again.

What happened is that Manjaro Linux discontinued it's minimal OS support for x64 machines.  
With the complaints against Manjaro being unsecure,  
I've decided to move away from Manjaro Linux altogether  
and move to Artix Linux instead.  

SE Bastille will be the name of this Artix Linux flavour.
